MEANING OF STATUSES

"ND" = "Not Done" = Step is not completed and functionality is still missing
"DNT" = "Done but Not Tested" = The code is there for the functionality but not all team members have tested it yet
"1R" = "1 Reviewer" = This means only one person has reviewed and tested the step.
"2R" = "2 Reviewers" = 2 people have reviewed and tested.
"3R" = "3 Reviewers" = 3 out of 4 members have looked at it and tested.
"4R" = "4 Reviewers" = All 4 team members have reviewed the step, tested the functionality, and ensured there is nothing wrong. "4R" is the final status and indicates that the step is fully completed and correct and there are no further objections.
