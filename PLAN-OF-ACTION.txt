MEANING OF STATUSES

"ND"  = "Not Done"            = Step is not completed and functionality is still missing.

"DNT" = "Done but Not Tested" = The code is there for the functionality,
                                but not all team members have tested it yet.

"PT"  = "Partially Tested"    = This means not everyone has reviewed and tested the step.

"D"   = "Done"                = All 4 team members have reviewed the step,
                                tested the functionality, and ensured there is nothing wrong.

"D" is the final status and indicates that the step
is fully completed and correct and there are no further objections.
